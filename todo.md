TODO
=======

1. Stop expanding when reached species
2. Don't expand when there's no data available
3. Use number of descendants (if available?) to order elements, prioritizing the most important and likely to have children data available
4. Expand to father... undo expanding, by clicking on root node
5. Fix UI left -> right -> left behaviour of graph
6. Add information on taxonomic level (Kingdom, ..., ..., Species)
7. Fetch every result available, even if they are more than 20. Current system make a single request, fetching only the 20 results.

Specio
===========

With [Specio](http://www.species-explorer.appspot.com/), you can explore the tree of life, from the kingdoms down to the species. Specio provides you with information and images about different groups of organisms and their evolutionary relationships.

Starting with the root of all Life on Earth and moving out along diverging branches to individual species, the structure of the tree of life illustrates the genetic connections between all living things. For each group and species, you can find information and pictures coming from the Wikipedia database, ensuring extensiveness and completeness. 

There are seven ranks in the tree of life: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species. You can explore the whole tree, at every level.
